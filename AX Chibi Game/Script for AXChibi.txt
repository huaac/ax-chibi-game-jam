Cat: *meows*

DL: You are right, Momonga! If the humans can't get it right, then I'll do it.

DL: Now let's see...How do the humans do it? Momonga, fetch me some chalk please.

Cat: *Meows*

DL: ...

P: "What was all of that?!"

DL: "What? I am a Demon King."

P: "So?"

DL: "Are you telling me that your world does not train you to fight demons in the case you are summoned to another world to defeat a demon kind?"

P: "No..this is not a common thing at all."

DL: "That...explains alot. How were you so skilled at dodging my attacks?"

P: "I just...sorta saw them coming? And moved."

DL: "Interesting..well you did give me a goodfight even if it ended in a draw-"

P: "Didn't you give up?-"

DL: "A Draw! And as I was saying, you are now granted a wish. I can send you back if that is what you would like."
