Demon Lord = DL
Protaganist = P


DL Start

DL: *sigh* Is there no hero that can give me a challenge?

Cat: *Meows*

DL: Well..it's not like I want them to beat me but come on! No one has gotten remotely close. Its sort of sad at this point.

Cat: *meows*

DL: You are right, Momonga! If the humans can't get it right, then I'll do it.

DL: Now let's see...How do the humans do it? Momonga, fetch me some chalk please.

Cat: *Meows*


Fade to Protag Start

P Start

P: Where's the bus? I just wanna go home and sleep..

CAT shows up (could be momonga): *meows*

P: Oh hi there buddy. Is your owner around?

Cat: *meows*

P: *moves towards cat and pets it (just moves to the cat)*

Cat then moves away and onto the street

P: Wait! Come back its dangerous!

P: *goes out to grab the cat but truck is driving towards them*

IDEA!!!

So P is **almost** hit by the truck but the truck stops just in the nick of time. But then P is teleported to the other world by the demon king anyways!

P: Woah..that was clo-

P Transported to the Throne Room

P: Huh?! Where am -

DL "You will be my worthy opponent!"

P "What?"

DL "No time to talk! We fight!"



DL One Liners:



tALKING TO CAT - "Momonga! I am trying!" *meow*

"I knew I could do better than the humans!"

"Ok you can stop winning now."

"Im serious. Stop winning!"

"Ok ok ok, take this!"

"Who-who are you?!"



Ending:

DL: "Ok I yield! You win."

P: "What was all of that?!"

DL: "What? I am a Demon King."

P: "So?"

DL: "Are you telling me that your world does not train you to fight demons in the case you are summoned to another world to defeat a demon kind?"

P: "No..this is not a common thing at all."

DL: "That...explains alot. How were you so skilled at dodging my attacks?"

P: "I just...sorta saw them coming? And moved."

DL: "Interesting..well you did give me a goodfight even if it ended in a draw-"

P: "Didn't you give up?-"

DL: "A Draw! And as I was saying, you are now granted a wish. I can send you back if that is what you would like."

P: "Oh..well I am not sure. Can I put it off? I'd like to explore."
